# **Technology Selection**

Build a recommendation system using a hybrid recommendation algorithm. This algorithm combines Content-based Recommendation and Collaborative Filtering to assign new tasks to employees in the system.

# **Workflow**

1.	**Data Preprocessing**

Export the necessary data for recommendations from the Task and Permission tables in Power Platform. Tasks are categorized into different types based on their various dimensions.

2.	**Construction of Similarity Matrices**

1.	**Employee-Task Similarity Matrix**: Based on the core of the content-based recommendation algorithm, calculate the recommendation score (A) of the current task for an employee by analyzing their historical task records.

2.	**Employee-Employee Similarity Matrix**: Based on the core of the collaborative filtering algorithm, calculate the similarity between employees using their historical task records. Using this result, predict and fill in recommendation scores (B) for tasks that an employee hasn’t performed.

3.	**Recommendation Score Calculation**

Final Recommendation Score = ∂ * Recommendation Score A + ß * Recommendation Score B (∂, ß are feature weights to be determined).

4.	**Filter Recommendations Based on Employee Status**

5.	**Periodic Update Strategy**

# **Optimization Directions**

1.	Use Reinforcement Learning to optimize the feature weights and similarity calculations in the current algorithm.

2.	Address the cold start problem for new tasks and employees entering the system.
